# Code-Quiz

## Description 

This project is a Code Quiz written and developed using Javascript Vanilla API. The user / player of this quiz/application will be presented with a start page witha start button. When the Start Quiz button is pressed the questions will start to display on the screen and the 60 seconds timer will starta  count down. A correct answer earns you a mark while a wron one deducts 10 second from the count down. The quiz ends when the time is up or when all the question are completed. Different players take this quiz and their different scores will be recorded together with their initials.  This is part of my learning journey  towards web development.

## Task
Creating a Code Quiz with different questions and store the scores in the local storage.

Acceptance Criteria:

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
* WHEN the game is over
* THEN I can save my initials and score


Once all questions are answered the scores are displayed and store.

## Challenges

* Determing the data type to use for questions. 
* saving the users input with scores.
* Accessing saved records from the local storage.
* Returning the arrays in a sorted format.

## Things I learned 
* How useful it is to break down code using functions
* Using API's in Vanilla javascript.
* Havng different javascript files pointing to the same html.
* Making pages interactive with event listeners.
* Storing data on the client side using the local storage.
